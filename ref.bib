ABSTRACT = {In response to the problem of high computational and parameter requirements of fatigued-driving detection models, as well as weak facial-feature keypoint extraction capability, this paper proposes a lightweight and real-time fatigued-driving detection model based on an improved YOLOv5s and Attention Mesh 3D keypoint extraction method. The main strategies are as follows: (1) Using Shufflenetv2_BD to reconstruct the Backbone network to reduce parameter complexity and computational load. (2) Introducing and improving the fusion method of the Cross-scale Aggregation Module (CAM) between the Backbone and Neck networks to reduce information loss in shallow features of closed-eyes and closed-mouth categories. (3) Building a lightweight Context Information Fusion Module by combining the Efficient Multi-Scale Module (EAM) and Depthwise Over-Parameterized Convolution (DoConv) to enhance the Neck networkâ€™s ability to extract facial features. (4) Redefining the loss function using Wise-IoU (WIoU) to accelerate model convergence. Finally, the fatigued-driving detection model is constructed by combining the classification detection results with the thresholds of continuous closed-eye frames, continuous yawning frames, and PERCLOS (Percentage of Eyelid Closure over the Pupil over Time) of eyes and mouth. Under the premise that the number of parameters and the size of the baseline model are reduced by 58% and 56.3%, respectively, and the floating point computation is only 5.9 GFLOPs, the average accuracy of the baseline model is increased by 1%, and the Fatigued-recognition rate is 96.3%, which proves that the proposed algorithm can achieve accurate and stable real-time detection while lightweight. It provides strong support for the lightweight deployment of vehicle terminals.},

  abstract = {Drowsiness and fatigue of the drivers are amongst the significant causes of the car accidents. Every year the number of deaths and fatalities are tremendously increasing due to multifaceted issues and henceforth requires an intelligent processing system for accident avoidance. In relevant with this, an effective driver drowsiness detection system is proposed. The main challenges are robustness of the algorithm towards variation of the human face and real-time processing capability. The first challenge pertaining to the facial variation has been handled well using conventional image processing and hand-craft features of computer vision algorithms. Yet, variations such as facial expression, lighting condition, intra-class variation, and pose variation are additional issues that conventional method failed to address. Deep learning is an alternative solution which provides a better performance by learning features automatically. Thus, this paper proposed a new concept for handling the real-time driver drowsiness detection using the hybrid of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). The performance of the system has been tested using the public drowsy driver dataset from ACCV 2016 competition. The results show that it can outperform the former schemes in the literature.},

ABSTRACT = {Driver fatigue is the culprit of most traffic accidents. Visual technology can intuitively judge whether the driver is in the state of fatigue. A driver fatigue detection system based on the residual channel attention network (RCAN) and head pose estimation is proposed. In the proposed system, Retinaface is employed for face location and outputs five face landmarks. Then the RCAN is proposed to classify the state of eyes and the mouth. The RCAN includes a channel attention module, which can adaptively extract key feature vectors from the feature map, which significantly improves the classification accuracy of the RCAN. In the self-built dataset, the classification accuracy of the eye state of the RCAN reaches 98.962% and that of the mouth state reaches 98.561%, exceeding other classical convolutional neural networks. The percentage of eyelid closure over the pupil over time (PERCLOS) and the mouth opening degree (POM) are used for fatigue detection based on the state of eyes and the mouth. In addition, this article proposes to use a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) method to estimate the head pose as an essential supplement for driving fatigue detection and proposes over-angle to evaluate whether the head pose is excessively deflected. On the whole, the proposed driver fatigue system integrates 3D head pose estimation and fatigue detection based on deep learning. This system is evaluated by the four datasets and shows success of the proposed method with their high performance.},
